Welcome to my corner of the internet. My [Blog](/blog/) is the main attraction, mostly a place to document things learned.

`zwbetz` is short for my full name, Zachary Wade Betz.

I'm currently a Software Developer & Tester at [Geocent](https://www.geocent.com/) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Here's my resume in [JSON](/resume/resume.json), [HTML](/resume/resume.html), and [PDF](/resume/resume.pdf).

As for formal education, I have a B.S. in Information Systems and Decision Sciences from [LSU](https://www.lsu.edu/).

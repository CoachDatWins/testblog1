Welcome to my corner of the internet.

Come on in and make yourself at home. `zwbetz` is short for my full name, Zachary Wade Betz. I'm a husband, father, and generally curious person.

A blog oldie: [Simple Pleasures]({{< relref "simple-pleasures" >}}).

A quote by one of my favorite thinkers:

{{< blockquote author="Carl Jung" >}}
Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.

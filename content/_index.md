Welcome to my corner of the internet. My [blog](/post/) is the main attraction, mostly a place to document [things](/tags/) learned.

As for formal education, I have a B.S. in Information Systems and Decision Sciences from [LSU](https://www.lsu.edu/). 

Wanna get in touch? Email me at `zwbetz@gmail.com`.

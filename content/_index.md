Welcome to my corner of the internet. My [Blog](/blog/) is the main attraction, a loose collection of thoughts, things learned, and who-knows-whats.

`zwbetz` is short for my full name, Zachary Wade Betz.

I'm currently a Software Developer at [Geocent](https://www.geocent.com/) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Here's my resume in [HTML](/resume/resume.html) and [JSON](/resume/resume.json).

As for formal education, I have a B.S. in Information Systems and Decision Sciences from [LSU](https://www.lsu.edu/).

Wanna get in touch? Email me at `zwbetz@gmail.com`

Find me elsewhere on on [GitHub](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh).

Some blog oldies: [Simple Pleasures]({{< relref "simple-pleasures" >}}) and [Things I Like]({{< relref "things-i-like" >}}).

> Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity. -- Carl Jung

Welcome to my corner of the internet. My [Blog](/blog/) is the main attraction, mostly a place to document things learned.

`zwbetz` is short for my full name, Zachary Wade Betz.

I'm currently a Software Developer at [Geocent](https://www.geocent.com/) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Here's my resume in [JSON](/resume/resume.json), [HTML](/resume/resume.html), and [PDF](/resume/resume.pdf).

As for formal education, I have a B.S. in Information Systems and Decision Sciences from [LSU](https://www.lsu.edu/).

Wanna get in touch? Email me at `zwbetz@gmail.com`

Find me elsewhere on on [GitHub](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh).

Some blog oldies: [Simple pleasures]({{< relref "simple-pleasures" >}}) and [Things I like]({{< relref "things-i-like" >}}).

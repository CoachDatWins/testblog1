Welcome to my corner of the internet.

Come on in and make yourself at home. `zwbetz` is short for my full name, Zachary Wade Betz. I'm a husband, father, and generally curious person.

My [Blog]({{< relref "blog" >}}) is a loose collection of thoughts, things learned, and who-knows-whats. Here's the [RSS feed](/blog/index.xml).

## Work

I'm a Software Developer at [HLN](https://www.hln.com/).

I have a B.S. in Information Systems and Decision Sciences from Louisiana State University (but we all know the learning never ends).

Here's my [Resume](/resume/).

## Various

A blog oldie: [Simple Pleasures]({{< relref "simple-pleasures" >}}).

A quote by one of my favorite thinkers:

{{< blockquote author="Carl Jung" >}}
Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.

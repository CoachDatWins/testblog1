This was heavily adopted from [Kev Quirk's disclaimer](https://kevquirk.com/disclaimer) because he said it so well.

This is my personal website. The opinions expressed here are my own and not those of my employer.

My thoughts and opinions change from time to time. I consider this a necessary consequence of continuous learning.

This blog is intended to provide a semi-permanent, point-in-time snapshot of the various thoughts running around my head. As such, any thoughts and opinions expressed within my previous posts may not be the same, or even similar, to those I may hold today.

I often write technical posts on this blog. They usually describe processes that have worked for me at the time of writing. If I find an error, I will fix it. Where possible, I will provide context as to why I decided to follow the processes I describe.

My technical posts are generally not the only way to achieve a goal, they may not even be the correct way to do so. They are nothing more than a document which describes how I personally scratched a technical itch, or overcame a problem I was facing.

I cannot be held liable for any damage to your systems, data, or anything else as a result of the posts I create on this blog. The processes I describe within my posts are provided as-is with no warranty whatsoever.

This disclaimer is subject to change at any time without notification.

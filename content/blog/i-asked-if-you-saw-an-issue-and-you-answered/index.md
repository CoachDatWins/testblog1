Every now and then the internet surprises you.

<!--more-->

I recently added a [footer link](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/zwbetz/blob/971cfdf4c0daa92ba86033082fd86f7c96246c0c/config.yaml#L57) that lets people (with a GitHub account) tell me when something is wrong. I often include code snippets in my blog posts. And while I strive to keep them accurate, sometimes I miss things, or an API has changed since I originally wrote the post, etc...

Well, 13 days after adding that footer link, I got my first [bite](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/zwbetz/issues/3).

It was not just any issue, either. This person took the time to write a good one. The details included: the post in question, what was tried, the error message, research into the cause of the error message, and an example of what ended up working.

It brought a figurative tear to my eye.

Be like [@mambocab](https://github.com/mambocab). If you see something wrong, odds are you're not the only one.

One of the cool things (curses?) of maintaiing your own site is that you have total control over the frontend assets. Don't need those JavaScript widgets? Remove them. That CSS library has a bunch of unused classes? Remove them. You get the idea.

There's a movement (dare I call it that?) to create websites with less bloat. Some participants even set fun goals, like every page has to be [less than 1 megabyte](https://1mb.club/).

I like fun goals. So I set out to redesign this site as lightweight as possible, while still keeping a few niceties. I'm constantly tweaking things, so by the time you read this, the design has probably changed again. So I'll stick to how things are at the time of this writing.

For the style foundation, I went with Bootstrap Reboot. My favorite part of Reboot is the native font stack. I no longer have to download external fonts, how nice? The major fonts of each operating system are targeted, so it looks good, and is fast.

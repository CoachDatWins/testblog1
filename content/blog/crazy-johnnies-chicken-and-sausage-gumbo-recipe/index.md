This recipe is an amalgamation of a few things: My dad had made some Crazy Johnnie's BBQ shrimp for a family event. Once I peeled the leftovers, I couldn't bring myself to throw away the juice because it smelled so good. My wife suggested making a chicken and sausage gumbo and adding the juice in. I had never made gumbo before, but my sister-in-law makes a good one. Between her recipe, and [Cajun Ninja's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqUOBaSVHZE) recipe, this one was born.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Tony Chachere's Instant Roux Mix
- 1 onion
- 1 green bell pepper
- 3 sticks celery
- 2 lbs smoked sausage
- 4 lbs chicken thighs
- 2 32 oz containers chicken stock
- 4 cups water
- 1 tablespoon Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 3 bay leaves
- 5 oz Heinz 57 Sauce
- 1/4 cup Louisiana Fish Fry Crawfish Shrimp & Crab Boil
- 1 packet BBQ Shrimp Seasoning

## Directions

1. Chop vegetables finely
1. Cook chicken thighs, then shred them (if you boil or pressure cook the chicken thighs, save the broth for later)
1. Slice sausage thinly
1. Make roux the hard way, or use Instant Roux Mix (I bet you can't taste the difference in the end result)
1. Once roux is ready, add vegetables, then cook for 10 minutes to soften them
1. Add sausage, Creole Seasoning, garlic powder, salt, then cook for 20 minutes
1. Add chicken stock, water, Heinz 57 Sauce, Crab Boil, BBQ Shrimp Seasoning, bay leaves, then bring to boil
1. Add shredded chicken thighs, then simmer for 2 hours

## Notes

- If you don't have BBQ Shrimp Seasoning, you can use any BBQ Seasoning
- If you like to shed a few tears while eating your gumbo (as I do), feel free to increase the Crab Boil quantity, then add some cayenne

I'm INFJ on the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, and a five on the Enneagram. So if your personality is similar to mine, perhaps the below is useful to you as well.

I've noticed a pattern in my life over the last few years. It goes something like this: Things are going well and I get caught up in this fact. So much so, that I forgot about the work put in to get there in the first place. Inevitably I get comfortable, and I'm back at that place which I hate.

I get joy from being an effective person. Especially in my job, as a husband, and a dad. But when I'm comfortable, I'm less effective in these areas. So what to do about this? How to appreciate when things are good, while still keeping my nose to the grindstone? 

> When you're happy, you get comfortable. When you get comfortable, you're less effective. So even when you're happy, be as if you're not.

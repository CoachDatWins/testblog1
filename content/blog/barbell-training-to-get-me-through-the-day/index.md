For some, barbell training gives them loads of energy for their day. For me, it does something just as good: it gets me _through_ my day.

You see, before I started lifting, I was tired all the time. It would be morning yet I was still half awake. Come afternoon at work, I was fighting off “the nod”. Then when I got home, I resisted the urge to nap — and if I sat down for too long, I fell asleep anyway. 

Since barbell training, I can make it a full day without drowsiness and without a nap. It’s as if squats, presses, and deadlifts give my body this mysterious self-regulation it was missing.

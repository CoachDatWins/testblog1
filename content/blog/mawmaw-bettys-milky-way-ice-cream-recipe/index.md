This recipe was given to me by my Mawmaw Betty. Her, my Pawpaw Allen, and my dad made this growing up. We've experimented with different candy bars over the years. My wife likes it with Butterfingers or Reese's. But I think Milky Ways still taste best. 

Eating a cup of this ice cream after eating spicy boiled seafood always hits the spot. 

## Ingredients 

* 8 large Milky Way bars
* 1 gallon milk
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 6 eggs
* 1.5 cups sugar
* 2 cans condensed milk
* 1 carton heavy cream 
* 8 lbs ice
* 1/2 box rock salt

## Directions

1. Take half of the Milky Way bars and melt them in 2 cups of milk in double boiler, or on oven with low heat in heavy saucepan
1. While candy mixture cooks, beat eggs until softly pitted. Then add sugar and beat well
1. Add vanilla extract and condensed milk to beaten eggs mixture. Then fold in cooled Milky Way mixture. Mix well
1. Pour into 1-gallon ice cream maker. Add heavy cream, then additional milk as needed to fill freezer to proper capacity (usually 2/3 is proper capacity, as ice cream mixture will expand)
1. Add a layer of ice around ice cream container, then sprinkle a layer of rock salt. Repeat until ice cream container is fully surrounded by ice. Add ice and rock salt as necessary while the ice cream makes
1. When ice cream is ready to serve, dice up remaining Milky Way bars and mix them in

## Notes

* If possible, put ice cream maker in a cool place. It will freeze much quicker
* If you want richer, more custard-like ice cream, instead of using milk to fill the ice cream maker to proper capacity, use heavy cream
* If you don't have rock salt, you can use regular table salt instead. Just don't use as much

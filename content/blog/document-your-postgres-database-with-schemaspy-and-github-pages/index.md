SchemaSpy is a nifty tool that, using their words, let's you _document your database simply and easily_. (Can confirm, it's nice). 

When combined with GitHub Pages, it takes the headache out of deploying the generated SchemaSpy site.

I made a template repo for easy reuse, check it out: <https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/schemaspy-postgres-github-pages>

My son likes to watch downloaded movies during long car rides. This bug is keeping that from happening.

## Describe the Bug

My account does not stay logged in. It usually logs itself out anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 day after a login.

This means that once a movie is downloaded to the Disney+ app, and the Amazon Fire Tablet is put into "Airplane Mode", the downloaded movie is unable to be watched.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the Disney+ app
2. Login
3. Download a movie
4. Put the Amazon Fire Tablet into "Airplane Mode"
5. Press the Amazon Fire Tablet "Home" button
6. Open the Disney+ app
7. Are you logged out?
8. Repeat steps 5-7 until you're logged out

## Expected Behavior

Once I login to the Disney+ app, I should stay logged in, even when the Amazon Fire Tablet is put into "Airplane Mode".

## Version Info

- **Amazon Fire Tablet:** Fire HD 8 (10th generation). Fire OS 7.3.1.9
- **Disney+ App:** Version 1.15.1 (2105270)

## Additional Context

I've tried these workarounds, with no luck:

- Reboot the Amazon Fire Tablet
- Uninstall and reinstall the Disney+ app
- Logout of Disney+ on all my devices

There are more factors that go into choosing a Navy Seal than just performance vs trust. But I get what Simon is saying, and it's true for me personally: I would rather work with a _high trust & medium performance_ leader, than a _medium trust & high performance_ leader.

> I worked with the Navy Seals. and I asked them, "How do you pick the guys that go on Seal Team Six? Because they're the best of the best of the best."
>
> And they drew a graph for me. On one side (y-axis), they wrote _performance_. On other side (x-axis), they wrote _trust_.
>
> The way they defined the terms was: performance equals performance on the battlefield (skills, did you make your quarterly earnings, etc.); trust equals performance off the battlefield (what kind of person are you, "I may trust you with my life, but do I trust you with my money and my wife?").
>
> Nobody wants the _low performance & low trust_ person. Of course, everybody wants the _high performance & high trust_ person.
>
> But they learned that the _high performance & low trust_ person is a toxic leader and a toxic team member. And they would rather have a _medium performance & high trust_, or a _low performance & high trust_, over a _high performance and low trust_ person.
>
> This is the highest performing organization on the planet, and the _low performance, high trust_ person, is more important than the _high performance, low trust_ person.
>
> And the problem in business is we have lopsided metrics. We have a million and one metrics to measure someone's performance, and negligible to no metrics to measure someone's trustworthiness.
>
> So, what we end up doing is promoting, or bonusing, toxicity in our businesses. Which is bad for the long game, because it eventually destroys the whole organization.
>
> The irony is, it's unbelievable easy to find these people. Go to any team and say "Who is the asshole?". And they will all point to the same person. [^asshole]
>
> Equally, if you go to the same team and say, "Who do you trust more than anybody else? Who's always got your back? When the chips are down, who will be there with you?" They will also all point to the same person.
>
> It's the same best-gifted-natural-leader who's creating an environment for everybody else to succeed, and they may not be your most individual highest performer, but that person... you better keep them on your team.

[^asshole]: I think everyone can acknowledge, that while assholes are a pain to work with, they can be useful to get things done.

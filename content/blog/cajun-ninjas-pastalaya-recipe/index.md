This is not my recipe, it's [Cajun Ninja's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5YR9pGxH0E). Transcribing and tweaking it for archival purposes. It's a keeper.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb pork
- 1 lb boneless chicken thighs
- 1 lb smoked sausage
- 1 onion
- 1 bell pepper
- 1 bunch of green onion
- 2 sticks of celery
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 3 beef bouillon cubes
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 3 1/2 cups water
- 1 (10.5 oz) can of cream of chicken soup
- 1 lb (16 oz) of bow tie (or favorite) pasta
- Salt and pepper
- 1/2 tablespoon of cajun seasoning
- 1 tablespoon hot sauce
- 2 tablespoon kitchen bouquet

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 300 °F
1. Heat a pot over medium heat (or high heat, depending on your stove)
1. Chop pork, chicken, and sausage
1. Chop onion, bell pepper, green onion, and celery, then move to fridge
1. Season pork well with salt and pepper
1. Add vegetable oil to pot, then start searing the pork
1. When you no longer see pink, turn the heat to low and simmer for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally
1. After 25 minutes, raise heat back up to medium, add the chicken, let cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally
1. After 10 minutes, remove pork and chicken with a slotted spoon into a bowl
1. Add the sausage to the pot, cooking 10 minutes or until you see some browning
1. After 10 minutes, remove the sausage with a slotted spoon into the same bowl
1. Add the onion, bell pepper, green onion, celery, garlic, cajun seasoning, and beef cubes
1. Sauté until completely soft, roughly 30 minutes
1. Add the water, cream of chicken, hot sauce, and kitchen bouquet. Raise the heat
1. When the soup has blended, add the pasta and meat back in. Mix well
1. Once everything is mixed nicely, press down on the top so that all pasta is covered by liquid
1. Bring the mix to a boil. Once boiling, cover, turn the fire off, and put the pot in the oven
1. Cook in oven for 1 hour
1. After 1 hour, remove the pot, then set aside for 5 minutes before uncovering

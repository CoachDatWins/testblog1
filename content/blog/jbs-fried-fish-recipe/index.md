Growing up, my dad (JB) was, and still is an avid fisherman. He prepared fish for us often, and taught my brother and I how to fry 'em. This recipe works for all kinds of fish: bass, bream, sacalait, trout, and catfish, just to name a few. I hope you enjoy it as much as our family has. 

## Ingredients

- Fish
- Zatarain's Fish Fri
- Tony Chachere’s seasoning
- Louisiana Hot Sauce
- Mustard
- Wax paper
- Paper towels

## Directions

1. Pour fish fry into a shaker bowl
1. In another bowl: mix fish, mustard (just a few squirts), tony's, and hot sauce
1. In batches: move fish to shaker bowl, shake well to batter, then move to pan. Use wax paper to separate layers
1. Refrigerate battered fish overnight. If pressed for time, refrigerate for at least 1 hour 
1. Heat a pot of grease. Grease should be between 340-350 °F when dropping fish, as it will drop to around 325 °F then rise as they cook. If you don't have a thermometer: you know it's hot enough when you can drop a fish (or french fry) and it immediately starts bubbling
1. In batches: drop fish and let it fry until it floats to the top, then move to pan. Use paper towels to separate layers and soak up grease

## Notes

- Cut up some onions into pieces about an inch in size, then spread them across your pan as a bed for your fried fish. Trust me, even if you don't like onions, you'll like this. There's something right about a bite with raw onion and fried fish.

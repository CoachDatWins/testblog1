My dad and his girlfriend invited us for a day on the Tickfaw River. Townes got to boat ride and net a catfish, so he was in heaven.

We were trolling along, listening to some playlist called _Feel Good Country_ when _I Believe in You_ by [Don Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Williams) started playing. I was at the front of the boat, facing away from everyone, and it wasn't long before I was silently tearing up, thinking to myself, _"Who sings this song and why haven't I heard it before?"_.

The lyrics are great:

> I don't believe in superstars\
> Organic food and foreign cars\
> I don't believe the price of gold\
> The certainty of growing old\
> That right is right and left is wrong\
> That north and south can’t get along\
> That east is east and west is west\
> And being first is always best\
> But I believe in love
>
> I believe in babies\
> I believe in mom and dad\
> And I believe in you
>
> Well I don’t believe that heaven waits\
> For only those who congregate\
> I like to think of God as love\
> He’s down below, he’s up above\
> He’s watching people everywhere\
> He knows who does and doesn’t care\
> And I’m an ordinary man\
> Sometimes I wonder who I am\
> But I believe in love
>
> I believe in music\
> I believe in magic\
> And I believe in you
>
> I know with all my certainty\
> What’s going on with you and me\
> Is a good thing\
> It’s true, I believe in you
>
> I don’t believe virginity\
> Is as common as it used to be\
> In wording days and sleeping nights\
> That black is black and white is white\
> That Superman and Robin Hood\
> Are still alive in Hollywood\
> That gasoline’s in short supply\
> The rising cost of getting by\
> But I believe in love
>
> I believe in old folks\
> I believe in children\
> I believe in you
>
> I believe in love\
> I believe in babies\
> I believe I mom and dad\
> And I believe in you

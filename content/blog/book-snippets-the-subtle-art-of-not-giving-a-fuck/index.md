## The Backwards Law

Page 9.

> ... Because here's the thing that's wrong with all of the "How to Be Happy" sh*t that's been shared eight million times on Facebook in the past few years -- here's what nobody realizes about all of this crap:
>
> The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one's negative experience is itself a positive experience.
>
> This is a total mind f*ck. So I'll give you a minute to unpretzel your brain and maybe read that again: Wanting positive experience is a negative experience; accepting negative experience is a positive experience. It's what the philosopher Alan Watts used to refer to as "the backwards law" -- the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the face that you lack it in the first place.

## What's the Point of This Book?

Page 20.

> ... I believe that today we're facing a psychological epidemic, one in which people no longer realize it's okay for things to suck sometimes. I know that sounds intellectually lazy on the surface, but I promise you, it's a life/death sort of issue.
>
> Because when we believe that it's not okay for things to suck sometimes, then we unconsciously start blaming ourselves. We start to feel as though something is inherently wrong with us, which drives us to all sorts of overcompensation, like buying forty pairs of shoes or downing Xanax with a vodka chaser on a Tuesday night or shooting up a school bus full of kids.
>
> This belief that it's not okay to be inadequate sometimes is the source of the growing Feedback Loop from Hell that is coming to dominate our culture.
>
> The idea of not giving a f*ck is a simple way of reorienting our expectations for life and choosing what is important and what is not. Developing this ability leads to something I like to think of as a kind of "practical enlightenment".
>
> No, not that airy-fairy, eternal bliss, end-of-all-suffering, bullsh*tty kind of enlightenment. On the contrary, I see practical enlightenment as becoming comfortable with the idea that some suffering is always inevitable -- that no matter what you do, life is comprised of failures, loss, regrets, and even death. Because once you become comfortable with all the sh*t that life throws at you (and it will throw a lot of sh*t, trust me), you become invincible in a sort of low-level spiritual way. After all, the only way to overcome pain is to first learn how to bear it.

## Hope for a Life Full of Good Problems

Page 30.

> ... You may salivate at the thought of a problem-free life full of everlasting happiness and eternal compassion, but back here on earth the problems never cease. Seriously, problems don't end. Disappointment Panda just dropped by. We had margaritas, and he told me all about it: problems never f*cking go away, he said -- they just improve. Warren Buffett's got money problems; the drunk hobo down at Kwik-E Mart's got money problems. Buffett's just got _better_ money problems than the hobo. All of life is like this.
>
> "Life is essentially an endless series of problems, Mark", the panda told me. He sipped his drink and adjusted the little pink umbrella. "The solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one".
>
> A moment passed, and then I wondered where the f*ck the talk panda came from. And while we're at it, who made these margaritas?
>
> "Don't hope for a life without problems", the panda said. "There's no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems."

## Where Does Happiness Come From?

Page 31.

> ... Happiness comes from solving problems. The keyword here is "solving". If you're avoiding your problems or feel like you don't have any problems, then you're going to make yourself miserable. If you feel like you have problems that you can't solve, you will likewise make yourself miserable. The secret sauce is in the _solving_ of the problems, not in not having problems in the first place.

## Emotions are Feedback

Page 34.

> ... Emotions are part of the equation of our lives, but not the _entire_ equation. Just because something feels good doesn't mean it _is_ good. Just because something feels bad doesn't mean it _is_ bad. Emotions are merely signposts, suggestions that our neurobiology gives us, not commandments. Therefore, we shouldn't always trust our own emotions. In fact, I believe we should make a habit of questioning them.

## Embrace the Pain

Page 37.

> ... happiness requires struggle. It grows from problems. Joy doesn't just sprout out of the ground like daises and rainbows. Real, serious, lifelong fulfillment and meaning have to be earned through the choosing and managing of our struggles. Whether you suffer from anxiety or loneliness or obsessive-compulsive disorder or a dickhead boss who ruins half of your waking hours every day, the solution lies in the acceptance and active engagement of that negative experience -- not the avoidance of it, not the salvation from it.

## You're Average

Page 43.

> ... Sometime in the 1960s, developing "high self-esteem" -- having positive thoughts and feelings about oneself -- became all the rage in psychology. Research found that people who _thought_ highly about themselves generally performed better and causes fewer problems. Many researchers and policymakers at the time came to believe that raising a population's self-esteem could lead to some tangible social benefits: lower crime, better academic records, greater employment, lower budget deficits. As a result, beginning in the next decade, the 1970s, self-esteem practices began to be taught to parents, emphasized by therapists, politicians, and teachers, and instituted into education policy. Grade inflation, for example, was implemented to make low-achieving kids feel better about their lack of achievement. Participation awards and bogus trophies were invented for any number of mundane and expected activities. Kids were given inane homework assignments, like writing down all the reasons why they thought they were special, of the five things they liked most about themselves. Pastors and ministers told their congregations that they were each uniquely special in God's eyes, and were destined to excel and not be average. Business and motivation seminars cropped up chanting the same paradoxical mantra: every single one of us can be exceptional and massively successful.
>
> But it's a generation later and the data is in: we're _not_ all exceptional. In turns out that merely feeling good about yourself doesn't really mean anything unless you have a _good reason_ to feel good about yourself. It turns out that adversity and failure are actually useful and even necessary for developing strong-minded and successful adults. It turns out that teaching people to believe they're exceptional and to feel good about themselves no matter what doesn't lead to a population full of Bill Gateses and Martin Luther Kings. It leads to a population full of Jimmys.

## Your Personal Problems are More Common Than You Think

Page 56.

> ... The truth is that there's no such thing as a personal problem. If you've got a problem, chances are millions of other people have had it in the past, have it now, and are going to have it in the future. Likely people you know too. That doesn't minimize the problem or mean that it shouldn't hurt. It doesn't mean you aren't legitimately a victim in some circumstance.
>
> It just means that you're not special.
>
> Often it's this realization -- that you and your problems are actually _not_ privileged in their severity or pain -- that is the first and most important step toward solving them.

## Eat Your Emotional Veggies

Page 62.

> ... The ticket to emotional health, like that to physical health, comes from eating your veggies -- that is, accepting the bland and mundane truths of life: truths such as "Your actions actually don't matter _that much_ in the grand scheme of things" and "The vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy, and that's okay". This vegetable course will taste bad at first. Very bad. You will avoid accepting it.
>
> But once ingested, your body will wake up feeling more potent and more alive. After all, that constant pressure to be something amazing, to be the next big thing, will be lifted off your back. The stress and anxiety of always feeling in adequate and constantly needing to prove yourself will dissipate. And the knowledge and acceptance of your own mundane existence will actually free you to accomplish what you truly wish to accomplish, without judgment or lofty expectations.
>
> You will have a growing appreciation for life's basic experiences: the pleasures of simple friendship, creating something, helping a person in need, reading a good book, laughing with someone you care about.
>
> Sounds boring, doesn't it? that's because these things are ordinary. But maybe they're ordinary for a reason: because they are what _actually_ matters.

## The Gist of Self-Improvement

Page 88.

> ... When we have poor values -- that is, poor standards we set for ourselves and others -- we are essentially giving f*cks about the things that don't matter, things that in fact make our life worse. But when we choose better values, we are able to divert our f*cks to something better -- toward things that matter, things that improve the state of our well-being and that generate happiness, pleasure, and success as side effects.
>
> This, in a nutshell, is what "self-improvement" is really about: prioritizing better values, choosing better things to give a f*ck about. Because when you give better f*cks, you get better problems. And when you get better problems, you get a better life.

## Problem Perspective

Page 91.

> ... Often the only difference between a problem being painful or being powerful is a sense that we _chose_ it, and that we are responsible for it.

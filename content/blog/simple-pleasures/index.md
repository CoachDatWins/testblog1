I am beginning to learn that it is the sweet, simple things of life which are the real ones after all.
{{< /blockquote >}}

After watching [why small pleasures are a big deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gv1CqAQVow), I started a list of my own. With a bit of passing around to family and friends, here's what we ended up with.

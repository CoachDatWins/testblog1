> ... Plato had an interesting idea. (Draws man-lion-monster on whiteboard). He said, "the man can learn", the man is capable of grasping theory, abstract symbolic representation of the case. Now, the lion isn't really capable of theory, but what the lion can do, is the lion can be trained. You can use your reason to train your lion. How do you do this? 
>
> Well, this is where Socrates is so relevant. Right, this is why Plato writes dialogues. Because what Socrates did, he took reason into the social arena. He goes into the marketplace and dialogues with people. This social interaction is happening, and the social interaction is being wed to rational reflection, and to inspiring people to try and overcome self-deception. 
>
> And so, using a Socratic Method, the man can train the lion. And then the man and the lion together can tame the monster. Not kill it but tame it. And what you want, is you want that teaching of the man, the training of the lion, and taming of the monster, so that something happens: you reduce as much as possible the inner conflict. 
>
> Plato describes wisdom as an internal justice within the psyche. In which the man has been taught, the lion has been trained, and the monster has been tamed, so they can get along together as much as is possible. This is what's known as an optimization strategy. If I let the monster rule, everything else shrinks to a minimum. What you want, is you want the right coordination of each part of the psyche so that each can live as much as it possibly can without putting the other two in danger. When you can get that inner harmony, that optimal relation. This mutuality of the most existence, for Plato, this is to experience a fullness of being. This is to be as fully alive as you possibly can be. It's also to experience a kind of peace because your inner conflict has dropped.
>
> So, this is very powerful. One of your meta drives, in addition to all the drives people have, they want to have whatever they're having without inner conflict. They want to be at peace with themselves. This, of course, is a powerful meta drive that you can tap into. Because if you have a strong drive within you to get this inner justice, to realize wisdom, this fullness of being, then I can appeal to it. I can appeal to it Socratically. 
>
> But notice this has an important component to it. Because as I reduce inner conflict, my self-deception goes down. And as I reduce my inner-conflict, I'm less ego-centric. Both of these things are making me more in touch with reality. So, I'm reducing inner-conflict, but the effect that's having is I'm getting a clearer vision of reality because my self-deception and egocentrism is going down. Now, that matters because as we've seen before, you want to be in touch with reality. You have a meta drive.

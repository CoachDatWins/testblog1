> ... Plato had an interesting idea. (Draws man-lion-monster on whiteboard). He said, "the man can learn", the man is capable of grasping theory, abstract symbolic representation of the case. Now, the lion isn't really capable of theory, but what the lion can do, is the lion can be trained. You can use your reason to train your lion. How do you do this? 
>
> Well, this is where Socrates is so relevant. Right, this is why Plato writes dialogues. Because what Socrates did, he took reason into the social arena. He goes into the marketplace and dialogues with people. This social interaction is happening, and the social interaction is being wed to rational reflection, and to inspiring people to try and overcome self-deception. 
>
> And so, using a Socratic Method, the man can train the lion. And then the man and the lion together can tame the monster. Not kill it but tame it. And what you want, is you want that teaching of the man, the training of the lion, and taming of the monster, so that something happens: you reduce as much as possible the inner conflict. 
>
> Plato describes wisdom as an internal justice within the psyche. In which the man has been taught, the lion has been trained, and the monster has been tamed, so they can get along together as much as is possible. This is what's known as an optimization strategy. If I let the monster rule, everything else shrinks to a minimum. What you want, is you want the right coordination of each part of the psyche so that each can live as much as it possibly can without putting the other two in danger. When you can get that inner harmony, that optimal relation. This mutuality of the most existence, for Plato, this is to experience a fullness of being. This is to be as fully alive as you possibly can be. It's also to experience a kind of peace because your inner conflict has dropped.
>
> So, this is very powerful. One of your meta drives, in addition to all the drives people have, they want to have whatever they're having without inner conflict. They want to be at peace with themselves. This, of course, is a powerful meta drive that you can tap into. Because if you have a strong drive within you to get this inner justice, to realize wisdom, this fullness of being, then I can appeal to it. I can appeal to it Socratically. 
>
> But notice this has an important component to it. Because as I reduce inner conflict, my self-deception goes down. And as I reduce my inner-conflict, I'm less ego-centric. Both of these things are making me more in touch with reality. So, I'm reducing inner-conflict, but the effect that's having is I'm getting a clearer vision of reality because my self-deception and egocentrism is going down. Now, that matters because as we've seen before, you want to be in touch with reality. You have a meta drive.

> Philosophers have various thought experiments for talking about this. One I'll sometimes do with students is I'll say, imagine the following: You go home one day and your parents say, "Come here, I want to show you something". And you say, "What?". They take you to this hallway that you've walked down a thousand times before and they press on a part of the wall, that for you, has never meant anything. When they press it, a door opens, and there's a room in there, and there's tv screens and video tape and pictures of you throughout all stages of your life. And then they say the following to you, "9 months before you were born, we were hired by the government to have you. This is part of an experiment. The government gave us scripts to memorize. We did this as part of a government experiment. We don't actually love you or care about you at all. We've just been following the script, doing what we've been doing because the government has hired us to do this. But we're obligated, now that you've turned 21 or whatever, to tell you the truth. We don't care about you. Now, we still have to keep doing this. When we leave the room, you can forget all about this if you want. Right, and we'll say what we've always said, we'll tell you how much we love you, we'll make sure that your needs are met. Just know that none of that is how we truly feel. Okay?"
>
> Now I ask people, how would you feel? And they go, "Well I'd be devastated". And I say, but nothing has changed. They'll still say all the same words to you, They're still going to treat you exactly the same way. And what people say is, "It's no longer real". 
>
> Here's another thing I'll do with people, I'll say, how many of you are in satisfying personal relationships? Quite a few people put up their hands. 37:30

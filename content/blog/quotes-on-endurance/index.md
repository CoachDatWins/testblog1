{{< blockquote author="Henry Ward Beecher" >}}
An acorn is not an oak tree when it is sprouted. It must go through long summers and fierce winters, and endure all that frost, and snow, and thunder, and storms, and side-striking winds can bring, before it is a full grown oak. So a man is not a man when he is created; he is only begun. His manhood must come with years. He who goes through life prosperous, and comes to his grave without a wrinkle, is not half a man. Difficulties are Godâ€™s errands and trainers, and only through them can one come to fullness of manhood.

{{< blockquote author="Romans 5:3-5" >}}
Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.

{{< blockquote author="Friedrich Nietzsche" >}}
To those human beings who are of any concern to me I wish suffering, desolation, sickness, ill-treatment, indignities -- I wish that they should not remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of self-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished: I have no pity for them, because I wish them the only thing that can prove today whether one is worth anything or not -- that one endures.

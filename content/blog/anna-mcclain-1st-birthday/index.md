Anna-McClain turns 1 this month. We had a small birthday with family and a few friends from church, a nice and cozy feel. It's so much fun watching her grow up. She's turned out to be quite the social butterfly, yet she and Townes are both mechanically inclined. They'll poke and prod and play with an object until they figure out how to manipulate it. Baby gates and locked doors don't stand a chance. It makes dad proud.

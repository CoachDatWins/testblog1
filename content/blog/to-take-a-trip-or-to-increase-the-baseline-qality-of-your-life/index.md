The irony of this post is that I am writing it while on a trip. Yet I think it’s one of those ideas that only strikes you once you’ve walked the grass on both sides of the fence.

Let’s say you take a trip to an all-inclusive hotel on an exotic island for 5 days, and because you’re frugal, you book it months in advance through Costco Travel. Let’s say it runs you $2,000.

That comes out to $400 a day, assuming you don’t buy anything extra. 

That’s expensive, so what is that getting you? Well, in my opinion, memories. Trips have this special “feel” about them. Your time spent just feels more intentional.

I’m not saying trips are an unwise use of money, I’m just asking, “Is it worth it?” Only you can answer that question for yourself.

What do I mean by “increase the baseline quality of your life”? Well, what are things you use everyday or near everyday?

Spend that money on a badass home gym, where you lift 3 times a week, and the cost per use your first year (hopefully you get more than 1 year of use) is approximately $12.82.

Spend that money on a quality, comfy mattress, and in 1 year your cost per use is approximately $5.48. At the end of 10 years, your cost per use goes down to approximately $0.55.

Ultimately, it’s an opportunity cost. For me, I had to opportunity to rest and connect with my wife. Considering the season of life we’re in (we have an 8 month old little rascal back home), it’s been well worth it.

Townes (or Townes-man as we like to call him) had his 6 month pics recently. Well he was 7 months at the time, but you know how it goes. Millie makes an appearance too.

Shoutout to [Ashley Landry](https://ashley-landry.com/) for these photos. She shoots in both [film](https://ashley-landry.com/2018/03/05/why-im-loving-film-lately/) and digital, and boy do I love the way film looks. It has such a timeless feel to it. 

The [full album is in google photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/wXuqAnSzkkCrTxT9A), but here are a few of my favorites.

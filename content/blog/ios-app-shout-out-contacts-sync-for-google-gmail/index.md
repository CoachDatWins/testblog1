Contacts Sync for Google Gmail is one of my favorite iOS apps. It sits in the background, silently doing one job, and it does it _well_.

I stumbled upon it when looking for an existing solution to my contacts sync problem. My "single source of truth" for contact info is my iPhone's Contacts app. Relationships are something I really value, so I like to keep an up-to-date number and email for folks.

I use email more than the average person, and manually typing an email address into the gmail "to" field was getting old. It would be cool if I could type someone's name and their email just _auto-populated_.

Well, with this app, I can do just that. I have it setup to auto-sync once a day.

I bought lifetime access in 2016 for $2.99. Some of the best 3 bucks I've ever spent. At the time of this writing, lifetime access costs $8.99, which is still totally worth it.

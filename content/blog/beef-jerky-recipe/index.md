My dad let me borrow his jerky maker -- a [NESCO FD-28JX JerkyXpress Dehydrator](https://www.nesco.com/product/fd-28jx-jerky-xpress-food-dehydrator/) -- over the holidays and now I have the bug. No, not covid, the other one, the jerky-bug. Anyways, these make for nice, little Christmas baggies. Let's geaux.

## Ingredients

- Beef (eye of round, sizzle steaks, etc.)
- Cajun seasoning
- Garlic powder
- Course black pepper
- Crab boil
- Brown sugar
- Tiger sauce
- Worcestershire sauce

## Directions

1. Cut beef into thin strips
1. Mix everything together and let marinate for a few hours. Quantities were intentionally not specified. My unpopular opinion is that each batch of jerky should be different
1. Place in dehydrator. The pieces can lightly touch but should not stack. Let it ride for 6 hours or more

## Notes

The [National Center for Home Food Preservation](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/dry/jerky.html) has some good info.

On prep:

> Partially freeze meat to make slicing easier. The thickness of the meat strips will make a difference in the safety of the methods recommended in this book. Slice meat no thicker than Â¼ inch. Trim and discard all fat from meat because it becomes rancid quickly. If a chewy jerky is desired, slice with the grain. Slice across the grain if a more tender, brittle jerky is preferred. A tenderizer can be used according to package directions, if desired. The meat can be marinated for flavor and tenderness. Marinade recipes may include oil, salt, spices and acid ingredients such as vinegar, lemon juice, teriyaki, or soy sauce or wine.

On storage:

> Properly dried jerky will keep at room temperature two weeks in a sealed container. For best results, to increase shelf life and maintain best flavor and quality, refrigerate or freeze jerky.

## Ingredients

- Beef (eye of round, etc.)
- Cajun seasoning
- Garlic powder
- Course black pepper
- Crab boil
- Brown sugar
- Tiger sauce
- Worcestershire sauce

## Directions

1. Cut beef into thin strips
1. Mix everything together and let marinate overnight. Quantities were intentionally not specified. My unpopular opinion is that each batch of jerky should be nondeterministic
1. Place in dehydrator. The pieces can touch but should not stack. Let it ride for 6 hours or more

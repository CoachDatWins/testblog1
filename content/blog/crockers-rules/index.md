I stumbled upon [Crocker's Rules](http://sl4.org/crocker.html) today.

It's funny, because I have this type of relationship with a few folks at work. It's sort of an unspoken rule between us, and it's nice.

> Declaring yourself to be operating by "Crocker's Rules" means that other people are allowed to optimize their messages for information, not for being nice to you.  Crocker's Rules means that you have accepted full responsibility for the operation of your own mind - if you're offended, it's your fault.  Anyone is allowed to call you a moron and claim to be doing you a favor.  (Which, in point of fact, they would be.  One of the big problems with this culture is that everyone's afraid to tell you you're wrong, or they think they have to dance around it.)  Two people using Crocker's Rules should be able to communicate all relevant information in the minimum amount of time, without paraphrasing or social formatting.  Obviously, don't declare yourself to be operating by Crocker's Rules unless you have that kind of mental discipline.

> **Note that Crocker's Rules does _not_ mean you can insult people; it means that _other_ people don't have to worry about whether _they_ are insulting _you_.**  Crocker's Rules are a discipline, not a privilege.  Furthermore, taking advantage of Crocker's Rules does not imply reciprocity.  How could it?  Crocker's Rules are something you do for yourself, to maximize information received - _not_ something you grit your teeth over and do as a favor.

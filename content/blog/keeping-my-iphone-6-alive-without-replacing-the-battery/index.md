If you have an older generation iPhone, you've likely felt the effects of a lithium-ion battery nearing the end of its lifespan. If you've update to iOS 11.3 or higher, apple enables "performance management". 

According to a support [article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387), in cases that require more extreme forms of performance management (i.e. my iPhone), the user may notice: longer app launch times, lower frame rates while scrolling, backlight dimming, lower speaker volume, gradual frame rate reductions in some apps, and/or apps refreshing in background may require reloading upon launch. 

Umm, check.

Per another support [article](https://www.apple.com/batteries/service-and-recycling/), your iPhone battery is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles. Well I've had mine since 2015, so 3 years of charging, at 1 charge per day, brings me to 1,095+ charges. Yep, it's barely hanging in there. 

Because I'm stubborn, I'm doing what I can to prolong the battery life without actually replacing the battery. Eventually I'll have to give in and visit an apple store, but until then, here's what's helped. 

## Make UI events less resource intensive

_General_ > _Accessibility_ > _Reduce Motion_ > _Reduce Motion_ (on)

_General_ > _Accessibility_ > _Reduce Motion_ > _Auto-Play Message Effects_ (off)

_General_ > _Accessibility_ > _Increase Contrast_ > _Reduce Transparency_ (on)

## Disable auto-brightness

_General_ > _Accessibility_ > _Display Accommodations_ > _Auto-Brightness_ (off)

## Turn off bluetooth 

Disabling it from Control Center will only disable it temporarily. Disable it from Settings to make it stick. 

## Free up storage 

Delete unused apps. Then install Google Photos, and once your photos are done backing up, delete them locally. 

## Turn off background app refresh 

_General_ > _Background App Refresh_ (off)

## Turn off location services

_Privacy_ > _Location Services_, then set individual apps to _Never_ or _While Using_

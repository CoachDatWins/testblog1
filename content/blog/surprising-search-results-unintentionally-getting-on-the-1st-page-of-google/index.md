When first making this site, one of the goals was to brand myself online. (The other goal was to have a creative outlet). If you searched for my full name, I wanted to be the 1st result, or at least on the 1st page.

Since that time, I've published a small set of articles. And funny enough, articles I thought were obscure one-offs, are now top hits...

<!--more-->

It's interesting, because I don't do anything to game the system. I don't do marketing. I don't have associated social media accounts. Heck, I don't even have a publishing schedule. I'll go months writing nothing. Then I'll bang out a few ideas back-to-back.

Yet there is one thing I intentionally do: Write things that are useful or fun for me, in the hopes they'll be useful or fun for someone else.

For example, it may take me hours to research, experiment, and solve a problem. I can then take this fresh knowledge and distill it down into an easily transferable format for future-me and others.

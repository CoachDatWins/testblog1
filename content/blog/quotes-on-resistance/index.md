We gain the strength of the temptation we resist.

{{< blockquote author="Friedrich Nietzsche, 1844-1900" >}}
What is good? - All that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself in man. What is bad? - All that proceeds from weakness. What is happiness? - The feeling that power increases - that a resistance is overcome.

{{< blockquote author="C.S. Lewis, 1898-1963" >}}
No man knows how bad he is till he has tried very hard to be good. A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means. This is an obvious lie. Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is. After all, you find the strength of the German army by fighting against it, not by giving in. You find out the strength of a wind by trying to walk against it not by lying down. A man who gives into the temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later. That is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness. They have lived a sheltered life by always giving in. We never find out the strength of the evil impulse inside us until we try to fight it; and Christ, because He was the only man who never yielded to temptation, is also the only man who knows to the full what temptation really means - the only complete realist.

It is no mistake that you absorb the power of enemies you defeat in video games. That is not unique to video games. That principle was borrowed from life.

{{< blockquote author="Friedrich Nietzsche" >}}
I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage.

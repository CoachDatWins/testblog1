I'm 28 years old this month. It only makes sense to pair it with a list.

<!--more-->

1. When my son holds up the "number 2", instead of the "peace" sign, he does the "loser" sign. It's great
1. I'm more productive when I'm sad or angry. Wish it wasn't so
1. Watching a movie or tv show should be treated like attending an important lecture. Get off your phone. Pay attention
1. I could eat La Carreta chips and salsa once a day
1. It saddens me how intentional you have to be to start and maintain friendships
1. As a kid, I thought routines were silly. Now, I can't live without them
1. Emotions are funny. They don't hit me in the moment. But you can bet that 3 days later when I'm driving through town, they'll come on heavy
1. Investing in quality tools is worth it
1. I'm amazed at people who can recall with detail what they're read / listened to / watched
1. Deep conversations with small groups scratch an itch that is seldom scratched
1. Consciousness is so much fun to think about
1. The "glue work" people. The people who quietly hold everything together, with indifference to the spotlight. You know who you are. Thank you
1. Thought I would dislike working from home. Nope, I love it. Longer periods of uninterrupted focus. No commute. Time for chores around the house. Pet my dogs whenever I want
1. Dark humor takes the edge off
1. Nothing like a meal to bring people together 
1. Wanna bond quickly? Be vulnerable 
1. The subconscious is a fascinating thing. I can work on a problem all day. Only for a solution to bubble up to me in a moment of boredom
1. It took me 7 tries to acquire a taste for bubble tea 
1. How do people play video games casually? Either play to win or go home
1. Genuinely ask other people how you can improve, then brace yourself 
1. Board games are an underrated way to spend a group date night 
1. As a kid, I looked forward to power outages. It meant candles and the whole family on pallets in the living room 
1. Naps on rainy days 
1. Uncomfortable conversations can be the most fruitful
1. Protect your hearing and eyesight. They only get worse
1. People underestimate just how much paid software is made possible by open-source software
1. Cooking, budgeting, and investing should be mandatory classes in high school
1. My son is in the "why?" phase. Why this? Why that? You're tempted to feel annoyed... Until you genuinely try to answer his questions. Put your philosopher hat on

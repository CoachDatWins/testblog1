## Teaching

- [Make a Hugo Blog From Scratch](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch) -- In my opinion, Hugo’s current quick start is ample. It does just what the name says, gets you started you quickly. Still, there have many requests on the forums for a tutorial that dives deeper than the quick start, and gets into some templating basics. The thing you’re reading is my go at that. Starting from scratch, we’ll build a Hugo blog.

## End-to-End Testing

- [NightwatchJS Template](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/nightwatchjs-template) -- Nightwatch is a fun, robust end-to-end testing framework. As with any popular framework, inevitably there are opinions of how things should be organized, and what you should or should not do. This repo is a distillation of personal lessons learned, providing a template to jump start your own end-to-end testing project. It comes with sensible defaults, but you can configure it however you like
